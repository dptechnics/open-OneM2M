Introduction
------------

The Internet of Things is evolving in rapid pace and there aren't many standards available. OneM2M
is about to change all that and we at DPTechnics encourage that very much. As we are an open
source company we find there must be a decent, fully open source OneM2M implementation free
to use by everyone. 

We have started this initiative after research and discussing with ETSI, one of the 7 standard bodies
in the OneM2M organisation.  

This OneM2M implementation will be hosted at github and DPTechnics will provide servers and 
hardware to test the implementation. Anyone who is interested in contributing to this project can
send a pull request or contact DPTechnics owner and founder Daan Pape at daan@dptechnics.com

Join the IoT standardisation revolution now, together we can connect any device anywhere. 

Specification
------------

The OneM2M specification is free for download on the [OneM2M website](http://www.onem2m.org/technical/published-documents).
These documents are the starting point for the implementation.
